Text Typing Game

Technologies Used:

Used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap to create a simple typing game.

Requirements:

• Random letters appear in a containing element, 500px wide, at an interval of 1 second.
• Every 100 milliseconds, all the existing letters move right by 10px.
• Pressing a correct letter removes the oldest instance of that letter, and increases the score by 1
point.
• Pressing a letter that isn't on the page decreases the score by 1 point.
• Pressing Escape ends the game.
• If a letter gets all the way to the right-hand side of the container, the game is over.
